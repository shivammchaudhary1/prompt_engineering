# Exercise:

# Create a variable num1 and assign it an integer value.
# Create a variable num2 and assign it a float value.
# Create a variable name and assign it your name as a string.
# Create a list fruits containing the following fruits: "apple", "banana", "orange".
# Create a tuple coordinates containing latitude and longitude values (e.g., 37.7749, -122.4194).
# Create a dictionary person with the following key-value pairs:
# Key: "name", Value: Your name as a string.
# Key: "age", Value: Your age as an integer.
# Key: "city", Value: Your city of residence as a string.
# After completing the exercise, let me know, and we'll discuss the solutions and move on to the next subtopic: Operators.


# num1 = 2

# person = {
#     "name": "John Doe",
#     "age": 25,
#     "city": "New York"
# }



# Create two variables, num1 and num2, and assign them any numeric values of your choice.

# Perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using these variables and display the results.
# Use at least one comparison operator to compare the values of num1 and num2 and display the result.
# Create a variable is_raining and assign it a boolean value indicating whether it is currently raining or not.

# Create a variable is_sunny and assign it a boolean value indicating whether it is currently sunny or not.
# Use logical operators to determine if it is both raining and sunny, or if it is either raining or sunny, and display the results.


# num1 = 60
# num2 = 25

# add = num1+num2
# print("Addition:" , add)

# minus = num1-num2
# print("Substraction" , minus)

# multiply = num1*num2

# division = num1/num2 
# print("Division" , division)

# compare = add > minus
# print(compare)

# is_raining = False
# is_sunny = True

# result = is_raining == is_sunny 
# print(result)

# Exercise:

# Write a Python script that prompts the user to enter an integer. If the number is positive, display a message saying "Number is positive." If the number is negative, display a message saying "Number is negative." If the number is zero, display a message saying "Number is zero."

# Write a Python script using a loop that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) and displays the result.

# Take your time to solve these exerci
