# Code Converter
The Code Converter is a web application that allows users to convert code from one programming language to another. It also provides code quality checking and debugging features. The project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and utilizes the OpenAI API for code conversion.

## Features
- Code Conversion: Users can input their code in a specific programming language and select the target language for conversion. The application then uses the OpenAI API to generate the converted code in the desired language.

- Code Quality Check: The application incorporates code quality analysis tools to provide feedback on potential errors or style violations in the user's code.

- Debugging: Users can test their code snippets and receive real-time feedback to identify and fix issues.

## Deployment
The Code Converter application is deployed and accessible online. You can visit the live version at https://code-converter-omega.vercel.app/.
